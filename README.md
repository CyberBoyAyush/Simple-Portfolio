# Clone This Repo

Navigate into the cloned directory:
`cd Simple-Portfolio`

# Make Your Edits
All primary edits happen within the `index.html` file. Open it in your favorite code editor.

1.  **Profile Picture:** Replace `profile.png` in the root directory with your own image (keep the filename `profile.png` or update the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag within the Hero section).
2.  **Hero Section:**
    *   Update the `<h1>` tag with your name or desired title.
    *   Modify the `<p>` tag with the typing effect to reflect your role or tagline.
    *   Adjust the `href` attributes in the call-to-action buttons if needed.
3.  **About Me Section:** Edit the text within the `<p>` tag to write your personal introduction.
4.  **Skills Section:**
    *   Modify the skill names (e.g., "Python", "PHP").
    *   Adjust the percentage text and the `style="width: ...%"` attribute for each `skill-progress-bar` div to match your proficiency.
5.  **Projects Section:**
    *   For each project `div`:
        *   Update the icon (`<i>` tag) or add an `<img>` tag for a project preview.
        *   Change the project title (`<h3>`).
        *   Write a brief project description (`<p>`).
        *   Update the technology tags (`<span>` elements).
        *   Set the correct URLs for the live demo/external link (`<a>` tag with `fa-external-link-alt`) and GitHub repository (`<a>` tag with `fa-github`). Add `#` if a link is not available.
    *   Update the "View More Projects" button link if necessary.
6.  **Tools Section:** Modify the icons (`<i>` tags) and names (`<p>` tags) to reflect the tools you use.
7.  **Contact Form Section:**
    *   **Crucially:** Replace `your-form-id` in the `<form>` tag's `action` attribute (`action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id"`) with your actual Formspree form endpoint ID. Sign up at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) to get one.
8.  **Contact Links Section:** Update the `href` attribute for each social media/contact link (`<a>` tags) to point to your profiles.
9.  **Footer:** Update the name and link in the footer if desired.
10. **Title & Favicon:**
    *   Change the `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section.
    *   Replace `profile.png` in the `<link rel="icon">` tag if you want a different browser tab icon.
